# üîê Security Features

#### RPPOM Consensus Security

* The RPPOM (Random Pool Proof of Multi-properties) consensus mechanism provides robust security through:
  * Randomized block generation nodes selection, making targeted attacks difficult
  * System resilience - even complete attacks on partial nodes won't affect network stability
  * 5-second block generation time with 10,000-30,000 TPS capability
  * Integration with SINOHOPE MPC for additional security enhancement

#### Multi-Layer Security Architecture

1. Senator Role Security
   * Asset management through consensus-based multisignature addresses
   * Significant financial stake requirement ensures network integrity
   * Change of Senators determined by Citizen votes
2. MPC with Trusted Third Party
   * Implementation of decentralized infrastructure based on Bitcoin
   * Censorship-resistant system design
   * Open and verifiable transaction processing

#### Protection Against Attack Scenarios

* System can defend against:
  1. Citizen Node Failures
     * Network remains stable even if multiple selected Citizens are inactive
     * Participation rate mechanism ensures high-quality nodes
  2. Double-Block Production
     * Automatic chain selection based on length
     * 17-block confirmation count prevents double-spending attacks
  3. Mining Pool Dominance
     * Protection against 51% attacks through:
       * Asset diversification requirements
       * Participation rate penalties
       * Asset freezing mechanisms for malicious actors
