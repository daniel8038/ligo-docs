# ðŸ’° BTC Layer2 Tokenomics

1\. $Ligo, Bitcoin Layer1 assets for governance (a governance token that gives holders voting rights, incentives, and staking rewards for layer2 assets);

&#x20;

2\. $AiGO, Ligo Layer2 asset for utility (a utility token that pays for gas fees and enables fast and cheap transactions on the layer2 network. $iGO will be abundant, 10 trillion, inexpensive at start, and sufficiently circulated). The value of our tokens is backed by Bitcoin as an asset.

Â· The design of tokenomics and consensus are critical to Ligo L2 succeed, both correspondingly enhance assetsâ€™ liquidity, security. We leverage the coming $iGO, which has quantity advantage of 10 trillion with70 years mining window.

&#x20;

Â· $LIGO already issued 1Trillion tokens on BRC20, distributed to community for free mint, to gain community loyalty and enthusiasm. $Ligo is listed in 9 exchanges following its release. With over 15,000 organic Web3 users, the future of the BTC ecosystem looks promising and potentially fruitful.

The team has designed BRC20 $LIGO to be fixed and deflationary, creating scarcity and promoting value growth while facilitating on-chain staking on Ligo L2. Conversely, the system has set L2 $iGO to be dynamic and inflationary, with token releases adapting to the L2 needs and DApp usage, aiming to hit an ATH at its various growth stages. This approach incentivizes the Ligo global community to continuously build the Layer2 through such distribution and the triple reward tokenomics of $iGO.
