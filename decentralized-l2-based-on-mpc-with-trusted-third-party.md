# ü§ù Decentralized L2 based on MPC with Trusted Third Party

BTC Layer2 will establish a robust decentralized ecosystem for Bitcoin, using the BVM (multi-programming support) and smart contracts. The current Bitcoin ecosystem projects based on new Bitcoin protocols, such as BRC20, NFT marketplaces, need to be supported by centralized servers, which are centralized, censorable, private, and unverifiable. The ecosystem built on BTC Layer2, a decentralized infrastructure based on Bitcoin, MPC with trusted third party, will be entirely decentralized, resistant to censorship, open, and verifiable.
