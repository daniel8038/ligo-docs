# ðŸŒŽ LIGO BTC Layer2 Architecture

Ligo Layer2 is a Bitcoin L2 Blockchain based on Multi programming language supported VM. It moves the computation of new Bitcoin protocols, such as BRC-20, to L2, making it a decentralized computing chain for Bitcoin. As a Bitcoin L2, Ligo operates as a blockchain that utilizes the RPPOM (Random Pool Proof of Multi-properties) decentralized consensus algorithm. This stochastic multi-asset equity pledging consensus algorithm allows decentralized mining pools to operate. The computation results are then stored as Merkle Trees and smart contracts, and the block state is finally written into the Bitcoin block as a witness to complete block generation. Validators are responsible for challenging the correctness of the block, submitting fault proofs for problematic blocks, and obtaining challenge rewards.
