# Validation System

### Merkle Tree

&#x20;    Bitcoin uses a Transactions Merkle Tree to save all the transactions of a block. Similar to Bitcoin's Transactions Merkle Tree, BTC Layer2 will use additional Merkle Trees: the State Merkle Tree, the Ordinals Merkle Tree, the Transaction Merkle Tree, and the Receipt Merkle Tree. These will save the computed results from the Computing Engine, and will be used for decentralized query and verification.

### Merkle Proof

&#x20;   For new Bitcoin protocols such as BRC-20, the BTC Layer2 computing engine will compute and save the Merkle Proof to verify the new protocol state. This is very important, as the state of all new protocols is verifiable, and the verification is based on BTC Layer2's decentralized nodes, using immutable Merkle Tree technology.
