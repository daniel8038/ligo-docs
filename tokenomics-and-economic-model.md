L igo Layer2 Design Philosophy

Ligo Layer2 is built according to a strong design philosophy: Decentralization, Multi-VM Compatibility and Sustainability. It's important to fully understand these principles as they guide the design of Ligo BTC Layer2.

1  ecentralized

ecentralized  is  the  most  important  factor  for  blockchain  to  survive,  be recognized and pursued by the whole world, is the foundation of safe and censorship resistance.  Ligo Layer2  always  adheres  to  the  concept  of  decentralized,  provides  the decentralized  support  for the  current  and  future Bitcoin protocols  to  improve the Bitcoin  infrastructure.  Ligo Layer2  is one of the  first  Bitcoin  L2  Blockchains  which  supports decentralized computing for new Bitcoin protocols, and will become the decentralized infrastructure for all Bitcoin ecosystem protocols.

2 Multi-V M Compatibility

igo Layer2 is based on the Multi-VM, which has been implemented by up to 5 programming languages including Ethereumâ€™solidity and has achieved substantial success. We believe that Ligo Layer2, as one of the earliest and most potent Bitcoin L2 solutions, will definitely establish a larger ecosystem over bitcoin blockchain.

&#x20;      Simultaneously, we have noted that the limitations of the current Bitcoin ecosystem are inevitably undergoing significant changes with the development of Ligo Layer2 and other Layer2 at the same domain. We also believe that the Bitcoin ecosystem will surpass all existing blockchains, including Ethereum. The development of Ligo Layer2 will greatly benefit Bitcoin developers, the community, and the web3 industry.

3 ustainability

Ligo Layer2 adheres to the principle of sustainability. The initial design of Ligo Layer2 maintains a very open stance, capable of supporting existing Bitcoin protocols, their extensions, and future Bitcoin protocols. We aim to keep the code design as simple as possible so that more developers can contribute to Ligo Layer2. We will maintain compatibility with existing protocols and tools, such as eth, to minimize barriers for developers and users within the our Layer2 ecosystem. This approach allows more individuals to focus on the applications themselves rather than spending a substantial amount of time adapting to Ligo Layer2.
